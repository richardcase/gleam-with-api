echo "🏗️ Architecture Components:"
echo ""
echo "1. Customer Data Model (src/customer.gleam):"
echo "   - Type-safe customer representation"
echo "   - Optional fields with proper handling"
echo "   - Data validation and serialization"
echo ""

echo "2. Database Layer (src/database.gleam):"
echo "   - In-memory storage with Dict"
echo "   - Full CRUD operations"
echo "   - Email uniqueness validation"
echo "   - Immutable state updates"
echo ""

echo "3. Customer Service (src/customer_actor.gleam):"
echo "   - Service layer managing operations"
echo "   - Error handling and propagation"
echo "   - State management with functional API"
echo ""

echo "4. Main Application (src/customer_api.gleam):"
echo "   - Demo of all CRUD operations"
echo "   - Error handling showcase"
echo "   - Progress reporting"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Demo Flow:"
echo "1. Initialize customer service"
echo "2. Create multiple customers"
echo "3. List all customers"
echo "4. Get customer by ID"
echo "5. Update customer information"
echo "6. Delete customer"
echo "7. Show final state"
echo ""

echo "🔄 Production Expansion:"
echo "To convert this demo to a full production application:"
echo ""
echo "1. Add OTP Dependencies:"
echo "   gleam_otp = \">= 0.10.0 and < 1.0.0\""
echo "   wisp = \">= 0.12.0 and < 1.0.0\""
echo "   mist = \">= 1.2.0 and < 2.0.0\""
echo "   sqlight = \">= 0.15.0 and < 1.0.0\""
echo ""
echo "2. Replace customer_actor.gleam with real OTP actors"
echo "3. Add REST API handlers with Wisp framework"
echo "4. Replace in-memory database with SQLite"
echo "5. Add supervisor tree for fault tolerance"
echo ""

echo "📡 API Endpoints (Designed):"
echo "GET    /api/customers      # List all customers"
echo "POST   /api/customers      # Create new customer"
echo "GET    /api/customers/:id  # Get customer by ID"
echo "PUT    /api/customers/:id  # Update customer"
echo "DELETE /api/customers/:id  # Delete customer"
echo ""

echo "Example curl commands:"
echo "curl http://localhost:8080/api/customers"
echo "curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\"
echo "     -d '{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"email\":\"john@example.com\"}' \\"
echo "     http://localhost:8080/api/customers"

echo "✨ Key Features Demonstrated:"
echo "• Type-safe functional programming with Gleam"
echo "• Immutable data structures and state management"
echo "• Error handling with Result types"
echo "• Actor-like service pattern (simplified)"
echo "• Database abstraction layer"
echo "• Comprehensive testing strategy"
echo "• Production-ready architecture design"
