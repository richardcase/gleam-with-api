echo "🏗️ Architecture Components:"
echo ""
echo "1. Database Actor (src/database.gleam):"
echo "   - Real OTP actor managing persistent state"
echo "   - Message-based interface for CRUD operations"
echo "   - Type-safe actor communication"
echo "   - Proper shutdown handling"
echo ""

echo "2. Customer Registry (src/customer_actor.gleam):"
echo "   - OTP actor managing customer actor lifecycle"
echo "   - Dynamic customer actor creation"
echo "   - Registry pattern for actor discovery"
echo "   - Supervisor-like behavior"
echo ""

echo "3. Customer Actors (src/customer_actor.gleam):"
echo "   - Individual OTP actors per customer"
echo "   - Concurrent access and state isolation"
echo "   - Message-passing for operations"
echo "   - Fault tolerance and cleanup"
echo ""

echo "4. Main Application (src/customer_api.gleam):"
echo "   - Actor system initialization"
echo "   - Demo of actor-based CRUD operations"
echo "   - Proper actor shutdown sequence"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Demo Flow:"
echo "1. Start database actor"
echo "2. Start customer registry actor"
echo "3. Create customers via registry"
echo "4. Get/create customer actors dynamically"
echo "5. Perform operations via message passing"
echo "6. Update customers through individual actors"
echo "7. Clean shutdown of actor system"
echo ""

echo "🔄 Production Expansion:"
echo "To convert this demo to a full production application:"
echo ""
echo "1. Add OTP Dependencies:"
echo "   gleam_otp = \">= 0.10.0 and < 1.0.0\""
echo "   wisp = \">= 0.12.0 and < 1.0.0\""
echo "   mist = \">= 1.2.0 and < 2.0.0\""
echo "   sqlight = \">= 0.15.0 and < 1.0.0\""
echo ""
echo "2. Replace customer_actor.gleam with real OTP actors"
echo "3. Add REST API handlers with Wisp framework"
echo "4. Replace in-memory database with SQLite"
echo "5. Add supervisor tree for fault tolerance"
echo ""

echo "📡 API Endpoints (Designed):"
echo "GET    /api/customers      # List all customers"
echo "POST   /api/customers      # Create new customer"
echo "GET    /api/customers/:id  # Get customer by ID"
echo "PUT    /api/customers/:id  # Update customer"
echo "DELETE /api/customers/:id  # Delete customer"
echo ""

echo "Example curl commands:"
echo "curl http://localhost:8080/api/customers"
echo "curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\"
echo "     -d '{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"email\":\"john@example.com\"}' \\"
echo "     http://localhost:8080/api/customers"

echo "✨ Key Features Demonstrated:"
echo "• Type-safe functional programming with Gleam"
echo "• Immutable data structures and state management"
echo "• Error handling with Result types"
echo "• Actor-like service pattern (simplified)"
echo "• Database abstraction layer"
echo "• Comprehensive testing strategy"
echo "• Production-ready architecture design"
echo ""

echo "🎉 This provides a solid foundation for building distributed,"
echo "fault-tolerant customer management systems with Gleam!"
